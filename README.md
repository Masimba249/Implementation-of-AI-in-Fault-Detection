Implementation of Artificial Intelligence in Fault Detection, Diagnosis and Classification in a 3-Phase Transmission. 
For any electrical power system one of the components that has really suffered a lot is the transmission line. 
A fault in the transmission line can result to massive loses which are always economical loses. 
A fault in the transmission line occurs because of two or more conductors are in contact with each other or ground. 
In most cases such like faults will always result to a blackout in the whole region and at times in the whole country. 
Under this research we are going to have a look at the implementation of Artificial Intelligence in Fault diagnosis and classification. There are various Artificial Intelligence techniques that can be used to detect Faults in the 3 phase transmission lines. These include Probabilistic Neural Network, KNN, Fuzzy logic etc. Fault detection and classification which has been mutually done based on the Discrete Wavelet Transformation before. These models were based on the three-phase current signals which were proposed by Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-NN, and DT classifiers.  In our research we will implement the fuzzy logic algorithm. 
The proposed model will be developed on the MATLAB tool where we will have a Simulink model developed for the 3-Phase transmission lines.
